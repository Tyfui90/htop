# htop customized for the AtomicPi.  Includes CPU Temperature display and Current CPU Frequency display (in MHz).

This is a modified version of htop, enabling the display of AtomicPi CPU Temperature and CPU Frequency.   Thanks to [redeagle](https://github.com/redeagle) for his [original gist](https://gist.github.com/redeagle/5227747)

Necessary steps to clone, build and install on a AtomicPi:
(Tested on a clean install of Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS)

Install the Prereq.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libtool autopoint libncursesw5-dev autoconf automake git build-essential
```

Clone the repo
```
git clone -b atomicpi https://github.com/leeadama/htop.git && cd htop
```

Remove the built-in htop
```
sudo apt remove htop
```

Build it
```
./autogen.sh 
./configure
sudo make install
```

Run it
```
htop
```
Then you can add the Temperature and/or frequency meter by pressing F2 and choosing the one you want.

Introduction
------------

This is `htop`, an interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`. It is developed primarily on Linux,
but we also have code for running under FreeBSD and Mac OS X
(help and testing are wanted for these platforms!)

This software has evolved considerably over the years,
and is reasonably complete, but there is always room for improvement.

Comparison between `htop` and classic `top`
-------------------------------------------

* In `htop` you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally
  to see all processes and full command lines.
* In `top` you are subject to a delay for each unassigned
  key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape
  sequences are triggered by accident).
* `htop` starts faster (`top` seems to collect data for a while
  before displaying anything).
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number to
  kill a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number or
  the priority value to renice a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you can kill multiple processes at once.
* `top` is older, hence, more tested.

Compilation instructions
------------------------

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
See the [INSTALL](/INSTALL) file for detailed instructions.

When compiling from a release tarball, run:

    ./configure && make

For compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

By default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing
the path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.

See the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.

If not all keys work check your curses configuration.
